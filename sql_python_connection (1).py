#specify the db name, and then the connection you're using (which is the previous
# function). 
#query is from SQL - that's exactly what's happening here. 
# what query do you want? In our case, we want everything fro abc report.
#we want to put it in a string, and since more llines than one, we use three ".
#cur.execute(query) is how we actually move forward. We execute query in cursor.
#iF YOU PRINT the cursor, it will tell you that the query is now set up to activate.
#we just need to call it. 
#how to call - result. fetchall is an inbuilt function .
# you can make it easier to read with a for loop. it's not necessary, but makes it prettier.
# then it iterates through a list. prints each thing one by one. 
#then it closes the connection - you must ALWAYS close the connection to the database.
#similar to files - when you open, you always need to close them.
# will always have db connection, always have the connector. create the db connection, cursor and query. 
#will always have the db_connect to the result line.

#try and except block to catch errors, such as you input the wrong database name or miss off a letter.
#or there's a general connection error. We have the wrong connection details. Password etc.
#finally code will be executed every time. 
#if we have a database connection that is open, we're going to close it and then print out a message.
